There are three major players in MicroChain:

* A、  SCS miner：run SCS and join the MicroChain consensus to get MicroChain rewards;
* B、  DAPP developer：develop DAPP and deploy its Smart Contract on the MicroChain；
* C、  VNODE proxy：provide a VNODE-PROXY to MicroChain.

In the MOAC ecosystem, these players have different responsibility and rewards:

* A. SCS miner: A SCS miner needs to deposit some MOAC to join a MicroChain mining pool. When a SCS was chosen by one MicroChain and start mining, it can receive MicroChain mining rewards as long as the MicroChain is running. The rewards usually was given as MOAC and shows up after a flush of the MicroChain. The deposit  will be deducted if the SCS keeps sending dishonest transactions or lost connections very often.

* B. DAPP developer: When the DAPP developer deploy his Contract on the MicroChain, he need to deposit enough MOAC to pay the SCS miners for their work. These MOAC will be distributed to the SCSs after each MicroChain block generated, and saved to the MotherChain after MicroChain flush.
 
* C. VNODE proxy: Need to pay deposit to register as proxy. It can get rewards from participting in the MicroChain and from transfer data of MicroChains. 

For the details of the deposit amount and how to get rewards, please refer to the smart contracts defined them:

1. subchainprotocolbase
2. subchainbase
3. vnodeprotocolbase

We suggested the users use official pools for our testing, so we can find bugs and problems in the testnet. 
In the future, users can form their own pools and benefit from them.
