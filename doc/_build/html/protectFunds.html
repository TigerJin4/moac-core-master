<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Bookmark your crypto sites. Use those bookmarks and only those.</li>
<li>Install the EAL Chrome Extension or the MetaMask Chrome Extension to
warn you if you go to a crypto-phishing link.</li>
<li>Use MoacWalletOnline Locally / Offline.</li>
<li>Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message.
Always verify information w/ a secondary source. Don’t click any
link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like
Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever. And if the scammy
clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don’t enter any
information on the page. Never enter your private keys, passwords,
sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message</li>
<li>Turn on 2FA for everything. Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses.
Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don’t use your phone number.
Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account
(look in privacy settings). Turns out, you and your BFF Mr. Hacker
can “recover” access to your account via that number, completely
destroying the point of 2FA. PS: MyEtherWallet is client-side,
meaning 2FA won’t do anything in our case. 2FA is for ensuring the
security of your password on a server. PSS: Don’t forget to
cold-storage your backup words for these 2FA things. It’s a huge
pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2FA’d.
?</li>
<li>For Token Sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on
the official site. Bookmark the URL before the sale, get the address
from the URL from your bookmark at time of purchase. Do not trust
any other source (especially a random bot on Slack). PS: When are
token sales going to start using ENS names?</li>
<li>Double check the URL &amp; Triple check Github URLs. Check it. Then,
check it again right before entering any information. This is
especially important for any sites that require usernames,
passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal
information. SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that
they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? Cross
reference Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the
project hangs out. Github URLs are much easier to fake and much
easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on
reddit, seek out the URL on your own. Following the developers of
these repos on Twitter, friending them on reddit (lol…but
seriously it’s nice because their name will be orange), or starring
said repos on Github helps.</li>
<li>Always verify that the site you landed on is legit. Especially if
you are about to enter your private key or download an application.
What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period
of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the
last week or the site “just launched”, err on the side of caution
and avoid it for a while.</li>
<li>Google the service name + “scam” or “reviews” Scam sites rarely last
long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a
collection of information over a single source. Understand that
legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative
reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one
talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or
the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a
flag as the first one.</li>
<li>Don’t ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer) Don’t
ever…but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The
number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA
your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give
someone access to your entire computer &amp; every account. ?</li>
<li>Don’t use brain wallets Brain wallets are wallets where the key is
derived from a word or phrase you choose. Human brains don’t have
the ability to create high-entropy seeds. Using a phrase that you
make up, even if it seems “rare” or “random” is not as secure as
using MoacWalleOnline’s randomness and these phrases can be
bruteforced by the millions. Read more. And more.</li>
<li>Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads. I
recommend going with uBlock Orgin. If you are already using Adblock
Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock
Plus settings and uncheck the box that says “Allow some
non-intrusive advertising”.</li>
<li>Don’t click on advertisements. With or without an adblocker, you
should never, ever click on advertisements.</li>
<li>If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean
out your recent history and autocomplete. This will prevent you from
typing kra… and having it autocomplete to the malicious krakken.com.</li>
<li>No one is giving you free or discounted MOAC. Even for completing a
survey. ;)</li>
<li>The guys who just finish their token sale don’t want to sell you
tokens via Slack DM. Neither does that smokin’ hot 125px x 125px
avatar.</li>
<li>Download the MoacWalletOnline Chrome Extension.</li>
<li>ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check
your balance via <a class="reference external" href="https://explorer.moac.io/">https://explorer.moac.io/</a> for mainnet.</li>
<li>Lastly: use your brain Think for a moment. Don’t assume, ask. Don’t
blindly follow, question. If something doesn’t seem right…if you
feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth…or if you find yourself
asking, “I wonder why I haven’t seen this on reddit yet”, there is
likely a reason.</li>
